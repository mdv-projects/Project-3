    <h2>Project 3</h2>

<p> My story consists of a one of a kind hunter that started from the bottom.
    His name is The BladeBow Hunter, and like his name he wields an unlikely weapon
    that consists of two weapons in one. It has an indestructible blade that can be
    wielded at the bottom and at the middle, and an indestructible string that can
    be used to trow an arrow with incredible power.</p>
<p>The Bladebow Hunter hunts people and monsters depending on the mission he
    chooses. He goes to the Mission board to get missions. He does 370 atk points
    per attack. There are three missions that catch his eye, one is of a Gunner
    called Gilbert the killer gunner. The second one is a monster called The Scarpler,
    and the third one is another monster called Nonsen the Blade.</p>
<p>He will hunt them to the end so he can get exp points to raise his level and
    become the most powerful hunter in the world.</p>
